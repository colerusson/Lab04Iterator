# Lab04Iterator
Fourth lab in CS 235, using an iterator nested class to add onto the linked list and iterate through it.
"The concept of an iterator is fundamental to understanding the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Iterators provide access to data stored in container classes (e.g. vector, map, list, deque, etc.)

Add a nested iterator class to your linked list to sequentially access list elements. Your iterator supports begin() and end() functions along with overloaded not equal ("!="), dereferencing ("*"), and pre-incrementing ("++") operators.

Use the list iterator to iterate, find, insert after, replace, and erase elements in the linked list."
